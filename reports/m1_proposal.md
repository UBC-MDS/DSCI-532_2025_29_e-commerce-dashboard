# Milestone 1 - Dashboard proposal

## 1. Motivation and Purpose

**Our role:** Data science consultancy firm

**Target audience:** e-commerce clothing store manager

For e-commerce clothing stores that have a wide variety of product SKUs, it could be difficult to analyze sales performance and market trends due to the volume of data. Fashion trends also change fast so itâ€™s important for a manager to have a dashboard of data to quickly understand whether sales are matching the fashion trends or if marketing strategy/inventory need to be adjusted.

## 2. Description of Data

## 3. Research Question and Usage Scenario

Amit is an entrepreneur who runs an online clothing store in India. Through his virtual store, he sells clothing items to customers across the country. He wants to [explore] his sales data to [compare] how the volume of sales orders vary by region/state. He would like to [identify] the locations that contribute the most to his revenue and [pinpoint] the regions with lower sales. Amit also wants to [understand] the top products ordered in each of the regions.

Using the "E-Commerce Sales Dashboard" Amit sees an overview of all his sales orders segmented by customer region. He can filter and compare sales trends across different regions to identify the ones have the highest and lowest purchase activity as well as top selling products. As he explores the data, Amit notices that customers from some states tend to place fewer orders. He explores the data further to [analyze] if there is any link between low order rates and delivery time.

Amit makes a guess that perhaps customers in these regions might be discouraged by long delivery time for their orders. However, the system that Amit uses for his storefront does not currently track abandoned shopping carts. He is therefore unable to compare prospective sales with actual sales orders. Amit decides to begin collecting data on abandoned shopping carts so that he can further investigate whether the regions with lower sales might have higher cart abandonment. This will allow Amit to negotiate how to optimize shipping times with his current delivery partners, or add addition service providers who have better coverage in those regions.
